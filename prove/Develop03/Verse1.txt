1 Samuel 17:45-46
45 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a sword, and with a spear,
and with a shield: but I come to thee in the aname of the Lord of hosts, 
the God of the armies of Israel, whom thou hast defied.
46 This day will the Lord adeliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, 
and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcases of the host of the Philistines
this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth;
that all the earth may bknow that there is a God in Israel.
